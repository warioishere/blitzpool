## ✨ What's Special About BlitzPool?

BlitzPool extends the original `public-pool` implementation in multiple ways to enhance usability, automation, and miner transparency:

### ✅ Core Features
- Lightweight, performant Node.js mining pool
- Full support for Bitcoin mainnet
- Stratum V1 protocol support
- Optimized for low-latency share submission with Nagle’s algorithm disabled by default.
- Includes further performance improvements like UTF-8 socket encoding, cached network selection, and efficient big number handling.
- Supports Extranonce Subscribe (XNSub) for dynamic extranonce updates
- loads of Telegram Bot Commands to get basic mining infos

### 🚀 Extended Features by BlitzPool

### 🤖 Telegram Bot Commands

The BlitzPool Telegram bot offers real-time interaction and notification options via the following commands:
Command	Description
- /start	            Displays a welcome message and usage instructions
- /subscribe	        Subscribe to receive block found notifications for your mining address
- /subscribe_bestdiff	Toggle Best-Diff notifications on or off (default: on)
- /difficulty	        Shows the current Bitcoin network difficulty
- /next_difficulty	    Estimates the next network difficulty adjustment
- /stats	            Displays detailed mining stats for your subscribed Bitcoin address
- /poolhashrate          Shows the current pool hashrate

- ➡️ Subscriptions are address-based and persistent – no account or login needed.
- ➡️ For Stats, worker addresse need to be given on every command. 
- ➡️ btc worker addresse can be send encrypted with an own tool, pls see next steps:

#### 🔐 Encrypted Address Tracking
- Subscribe with **encrypted BTC addresses** for enhanced privacy
- Addresses are decrypted internally and securely matched to your mining activity

Use our Encryption tool for btc worker addresses here:

#### 🛠️ Extra Services
- Integrated `blockTemplateInterval` configuration
- Hashrate corrections and updated statistics endpoints
- Extended `/api/info/chart` endpoint with a `range` query supporting `1d` and `1m`
- Pool hashrate statistics are kept for one month
- Worker shares and total shares per address are kept for six months while session details are pruned after one day
- Example: `GET /api/info/chart?range=1m` returns one month of pool hashrate data (defaults to `1d`)
- Telegram bot subscriptions managed via a custom ORM
- New `/api/info/shares` endpoint provides pool-wide accepted and rejected share totals
- New `/api/info/rejected` endpoint lists rejected share reasons pool-wide (supports `range=1d|3d|7d`)
- New `/api/client/<btc_address>/rejected` shows rejected reasons for a specific address (supports `range=1d|3d|7d`)
- Old jobs are cleaned after 90 seconds by default (`JOB_RETENTION_MS` can adjust this)
- Desired share rate per worker can be tuned with `TARGET_SHARES_PER_MINUTE` (default `6`)
- How often miners are checked for new difficulty can be set via `DIFFICULTY_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` (default `60000` ms)

## Database Configuration

BlitzPool supports SQLite (default) and PostgreSQL backends. Select the database with the `DB_TYPE` environment variable:

- `DB_TYPE=sqlite` uses a local file-based database and requires no further settings.
- `DB_TYPE=postgres` enables PostgreSQL. Configure connection details with `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_NAME`. Default credentials in example env files use `blitzpool` for user, password, and database name.

See `.env.example` or `full-setup/blitzpool-example.env` for sample values.

## API

- `GET /api/info/chart?range=1d|1m` – Returns pool hashrate statistics.
- `GET /api/info/shares` – Provides pool-wide accepted and rejected share totals.
- `GET /api/info/rejected?range=1d|3d|7d` – Lists rejected share reasons pool-wide (difficulty weighted).
- `GET /api/info/version` – Returns the BlitzPool version.
- `GET /api/client/<btc_address>/rejected?range=1d|3d|7d` – Shows rejected reasons for a specific address (counts per share).

#### Blitzpool-UI

Blitzpool UI can be found here:
